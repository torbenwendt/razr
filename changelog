Note: "[!]" Indicates a change that
- changes the default behavior of RAZR or
- might introduce incompatibilities with earlier versions.


revision 0.92 (Dec. 2017)

* [!] Fixed: Image source jitter is attenuated if it would cause an image source
  being closer to the receiver than the direct sound source.
* [!] op.ism_ISposRandFactor was replaced by op.ism_jitter_factor. Jittering now
  depends on ISM order instead of img src distance to receiver.
  op.ism_randFactorsInCart was renamed to op.ism_jitter_type and takes string
  values now.
* apply_rir: New parameters 'samples' and 'win'. See help apply_rir for details.
* schroeder_rt: plots EDC automatically if nargout == 0.
* [!] New handling of wall materials. Own databases for absorption coefficients
  can now be created and used. For syntax see help razr.
* [!] New handling of configuration. Several cfg files can be stored in parallel
  now. The function select_razr_cfg picks the desired one. See doc of
  "razr_cfg_default" and "select_razr_cfg" for details.
* The SOFA format (sofaconventions.org) for HRTFs is supported now.
* [!] New syntax for adding unsupported HRTF databases (non-SOFA format). See
  README for details.
* New functions: sop, smat. Search tools for option names and absorbing
  materials, respectively.
* ISM needs less memory now.
* [!] RIR length is now specified in samples instead of seconds. Therefore, the
  options "op.tlen" and "op.tlen_max" were replaced by new options "op.len" and
  "op.len_max", respectively.
* [!] The automatically chosen RIR length is now set to the maximum of
  the estimated T60 over frequencies instead of the doubled maximum. However,
  this behavior can be controlled using the new option "op.len_rt_factor".


revision 0.91 (Apr. 2017)

* New function plot_ispos to plot image source positions
* The razr output "ism_data" now contains more fields
* scene:
    - Plots room even if srcpos/recpos/recdir are not existing
    - Colors of sources and receivers can now be specified
    - For multiple sources/receivers, labels have now the same color
    - Structure of returned handles is more clear now
* New function plot_freqrsp: Replaces plotFrqRsp
* Some code cleanup and refactoring.
* Some minor fixes
* schroeder_rt:
    - can plot the reverberation time against frequencies now
    - new option to plot the linear EDC fit
* [!] No random jitter on 1st-order img-src positions. New option to explicitly
  control that threshold order: op.ism_rand_start_order.


revision 0.90 (Nov. 2016)

* New options for scene: hide_labels, labeloffset
* Disabled tone correction filter on direct sound
* Introduced spherical head model. The according new spat_mode 'shm' is now the
  default instead of 'ild'
* razr addpath/rmpath ignores .git folder now
* razr_cfg is now only created for razr addpath (not rmpath)
* "razr" is printed in lower case letters for razr short help
* apply_hrtf: replaced feval by eval for calling scripts (warning in older
  Matlab versions)


revision 0.11 (Oct. 2016)

* Simpler folder structure
* Changed way of including unsupported HRTF databases (see README.txt)
* Multiple sound sources and receivers are supported now (see
  example_multiple_src.m). Updated analysis tools: scene, plot_ir, plot_irspec.
